# Task Manager API

A simple RESTful API for managing tasks, built with Go and the Gin framework. This project provides a complete, thread-safe, and well-structured backend service for basic CRUD operations.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following software installed on your system:
- **Go**: Version 1.20 or later is recommended.
- **Postman or curl**: For testing the API endpoints manually.

### Installation

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd task_manager
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Go modules will handle the installation of required packages (like Gin and Testify) automatically. Run the following command to ensure all dependencies are downloaded and the `go.sum` file is correct.
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the API server, run the following command from the root of the project directory (`task_manager/`):

```bash
go run main.go
```

If successful, you will see output from the Gin framework indicating that the server is running. By default, it listens on port **8080**.

```
[GIN-debug] [WARNING] Creating an Engine instance with the Logger and Recovery middleware already attached.

[GIN-debug] Listening and serving HTTP on :8080
```

The API is now live and ready to accept requests at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Running Tests

This project includes a comprehensive test suite for the data service layer. To run all tests:

1.  Navigate to the project root directory.
2.  Run the standard Go test command. It is recommended to use the `-v` flag for verbose output and `-count=1` to disable the test cache for a fresh run.

    ```bash
    go test -v -count=1 ./...
    ```

    - **`-v`**: Enables verbose mode, which lists each test as it runs.
    - **`-count=1`**: Disables the test cache, forcing the tests to re-run.
    - **`./...`**: Tells Go to run tests in the current directory and all sub-directories.

A successful test run will produce output similar to this:

```
=== RUN   TestAddTask
--- PASS: TestAddTask (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestGetTasks
--- PASS: TestGetTasks (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestGetTaskById
=== RUN   TestGetTaskById/should_find_an_existing_task
--- PASS: TestGetTaskById/should_find_an_existing_task (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestGetTaskById/should_return_an_error_for_a_non-existent_task
--- PASS: TestGetTaskById/should_return_an_error_for_a_non-existent_task (0.00s)
--- PASS: TestGetTaskById (0.00s)
... (more tests) ...
PASS

## API Endpoint Reference

This section provides the detailed API contract.

### Task Model

This is the core data object used in the API for requests and responses.

|---------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `id`          | integer   | The unique identifier for the task. Automatically generated by the server.     | No                        |
| `title`       | string    | The title of the task.                                                         | **Yes**                   |

| `duedate`     | string    | The due date in RFC3339 format (e.g., `"2024-12-15T17:00:00Z"`).                 | **Yes**                   |
| `status`      | string    | The current status of the task. Must be one of the allowed values listed below. | **Yes**                   |

#### Allowed Status Values
*   `"Pending"`
*   `"In progress"`
*   `"Done"`

### Endpoints

#### 1. Create a New Task

Creates a new task.

- **Endpoint**: `POST /tasks`
- **Request Body**: A JSON object representing a `Task` (the `id` field is ignored).

  **Example Request:**
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Create API Documentation",
    "description": "Write a markdown file describing all endpoints.",
    "duedate": "2024-11-10T11:00:00Z",
    "status": "Pending"
  }
  ```

- **Responses**:
  - **`201 Created`**: The task was created successfully. The response body contains the newly created task object.
    ```json
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Create API Documentation",
      "description": "Write a markdown file describing all endpoints.",
